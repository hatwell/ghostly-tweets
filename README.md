# ghostly-tweets

This is a very simple twitter bot I made to answer the question "if a ghost could tweet, what would it tweet?"

Sadly, ghosts cannot hold phones and do not have real fingers, so tweeting is out of the question for them.

I learned how to make this twitter bot by following [this excellent tutorial](https://github.com/jenkr55) from [Jennifer Kruse](https://github.com/jenkr55).

I also had some help from [this guy](https://github.com/tef).

Incidentally, this is my first time using markdown, and I used [this great guide](https://daringfireball.net/).
